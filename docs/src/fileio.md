## Saving patterns

This package can load/save patterns in the GDS-II format for use with e-beam lithography
systems. In the future it may be useful to implement machine-specific pattern formats to
force fracturing or dosing in an explicit manner.

```@docs
    savegds(::AbstractString, ::Cell, ::Cell...)
```

Using the [Cairo graphics library](https://cairographics.org), it is possible to save
patterns into SVG, PDF, and EPS vector graphics formats, or into the PNG raster graphic
format. This enables patterns to be displayed in web browsers, publications, presentations,
and so on. You can save a cell to a graphics file by, e.g. `save("/path/to/file.svg", mycell)`.
Note that cell references and arrays are not saved, so you should flatten cells if desired
before saving them.

Possible keyword arguments include:

- `width`: Specifies the width parameter. A unitless number will give the width in pixels,
72dpi. You can also give a length in any unit using a `Unitful.Quantity`, e.g. `u"4inch"` if
you had previously done `using Unitful`.
- `height`: Specifies the height parameter. A unitless number will give the width in pixels,
72dpi. You can also give a length in any unit using a `Unitful.Quantity`. The aspect ratio
of the output is always preserved so specify either `width` or `height`.
- `layercolors`: Should be a dictionary with `Int` keys for layers and RGBA tuples as values.
For example, (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5) is red with 50% opacity.
- `bboxes`: Specifies whether to draw bounding boxes around the bounds of cell arrays or
  cell references (true/false).
